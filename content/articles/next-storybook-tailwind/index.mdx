Let's take a look at how to setup a next.js application using [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for css and [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for testing the UI.

I'll walk you through setting up your application and building out a single login form component. 

## Create a next app

```
npx create-next-app <app-name>
```

Replace `<app-name>` with whatever you want to name your app.

`cd` into the app directory and run `npm run dev`  or `yarn dev` to start the development server.

## Storybook

### Install storybook

Use the following command to install storybook

```
npx sb init --builder webpack5
```

Update the storybook scripts in package.json to serve the public directory:

```
"scripts": {
+    "storybook": "start-storybook -p 6006 -s ./public",
+    "build-storybook": "build-storybook -s public"
}
```

### Next Images for Storybook

Next and storybook sometimes conflict with eachother. For example, storybook doesn't know how to handle next `Image`s. However, we just need to install a library that fixes these types of conflicts.

Install the [`storybook-addon-next`](https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-next) addon


```
npm install storybook-addon-next
```


Then register the Addon in `.storybook/main.js`


```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  addons: [
    // ...
    'storybook-addon-next'
    // ...
  ]
}
```

### Global Styles

Storybook also doesn't know about the global styles we're using in our app.

Add the following to the top of `./storybook/preview.js` so that storybook knows about our global styles


```js
import "../styles/globals.css"
```

### Delete Default Stories

Storybook has a stories directory that comes with the default installation, but we don't need them.

Delete the `stories` directory then adjust the `stories` paths in `.storybook/main.js`:


```js
module.exports = {
     stories: [
          "../components/**/*.stories.mdx",
          "../components/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)",
     ],
```

We're going to keep the stories with the components, so you just need to tell storybook about where your components are going to be. 

## Components

Create a `components` directory in the root of your project. This is where you can store all components that aren't pages. These are the components that we will test with storybook. 

## Login Form

Let's make a quick login form to see how storybook works.


Create a `LoginForm` directory in the `components` directory that contains the following two files:


* `index.jsx` - the component
* `LoginForm.stories.js` - the story


Add the following code to `index.js`


```jsx
import { useState } from "react"

export default function LoginForm({ onLogin }) {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState("")
  const [password, setPassword] = useState("")

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    onLogin({ username, password })
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label htmlFor="email-address">
        Username:
      </label>
      <input
        id="email-address"
        type="text"
        value={username}
        onChange={(event) => setUsername(event.target.value)}
      />
      <label htmlFor="password">
        Password:
      </label>
      <input
        id="password"
        type="password"
        value={password}
        onChange={(event) => setPassword(event.target.value)}
      />
      <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

This is just a super basic login form component that takes an `onLogin` prop that is called when the form is submitted. Now let's test this component. We have two options:

1. Add the component to a page and test it there
2. Create a story for the component and test it in storybook

Try both ways and see what you prefer, here's how to do it in storybook:

Add the following code to `LoginForm.stories.js`


```jsx
import LoginForm from "./index"

// The default export metadata controls how Storybook lists your stories and provides information used by addons. 
// https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction#default-export
export default {
  title: "LoginForm",
  component: LoginForm,
}

// Any other named exports will be treated as stories, which should be functions that return your component
export const Default = () => <LoginForm />
```

At a bare minimum, that's all we need. 

Each named export is a story, so `Default` is the only story in this stories file. We can add more later if we want for different variations of the component. For example, we could add a story for a loading state.


Run `npm run storybook` or `yarn storybook` to start storybook


The styling is awful, we'll get to that in a minute, but there's our login form.

### Actions

Update the Login form story to use the `actions` addon:

```js
export default {
  title: "LoginForm",
  component: LoginForm,
  argTypes: {
    onLogin: { action: 'search' },
  }
}

export const Default = (args) => <LoginForm {...args} />
```

Now when you click the login button, you'll see the action logged in the actions panel.

Now that storybook is setup, you can brows the [storybook docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction) to learn more about all the different things you can do with stories.

## Tailwind

Install tailwind using these instructions:


[https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs)

Sorry for sending you to another website, but the tailwind site has great docs and I don't want to copy them here.


Update the login form to use tailwind classes:


```jsx
  return (
    <form className="mt-8 space-y-6" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <div className="-space-y-px rounded-md shadow-sm">
        <div>
          <label htmlFor="email-address" className="sr-only">
            Username:
          </label>
          <input
            id="email-address"
            placeholder="Email address"
            className="relative block w-full appearance-none rounded-none rounded-t-md border border-gray-300 px-3 py-2 text-gray-900 placeholder-gray-500 focus:z-10 focus:border-indigo-500 focus:outline-none focus:ring-indigo-500 sm:text-sm"
            type="text"
            value={username}
            onChange={(event) => setUsername(event.target.value)}
          />
          <label htmlFor="password" className="sr-only">
            Password
          </label>
          <input
            id="password"
            placeholder="Password"
            className="relative block w-full appearance-none rounded-none rounded-b-md border border-gray-300 px-3 py-2 text-gray-900 placeholder-gray-500 focus:z-10 focus:border-indigo-500 focus:outline-none focus:ring-indigo-500 sm:text-sm"

            type="password"
            value={password}
            onChange={(event) => setPassword(event.target.value)}
          />
        </div>
        <button
          className="group relative flex w-full justify-center rounded-md border border-transparent bg-indigo-600 py-2 px-4 text-sm font-medium text-white hover:bg-indigo-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:ring-offset-2"

          type="submit">Login</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  )
```

Now view your login form in storybook and you'll see it looks a lot better. And now that you have storybook setup, you can easily test out different tailwind classes to see how they look. And here's a [cheat sheet](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet) to help you out.
