SQL databases have been around since the 70s and most websites these days use a SQL database to store data. However, SQL Injection attacks have been one of the most most common hacking techniques for the past 20 years.

In this video, we will take a look at how to perform some SQL injection attacks on a site, and we'll learn how to protect our sites from attacks.

The site I made serves up data about the Oscars. just enter the name of an actor, and you get details about them. I have two versions of this site, one in javascript using node, and one in PHP. We hack both versions.
