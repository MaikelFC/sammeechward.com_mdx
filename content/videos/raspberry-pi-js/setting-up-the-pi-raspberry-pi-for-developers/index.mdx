This is the first in a video series about how to get started making things with a raspberry pi. It is targeted at existing developers but will be helpful to you no matter what your background is.

Entire Series: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0X6fGhFFNTfW6RL46Rtd0VSqVtj-yBSd](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0X6fGhFFNTfW6RL46Rtd0VSqVtj-yBSd)

In the next video, we get this thing connected to the Internet and learn how to control the pi wirelessly: [https://youtu.be/hArqrFTq5vQ](https://youtu.be/hArqrFTq5vQ)

For this video, you will need:
* Raspberry pi & its power supply
* Micro sd card with a capacity of at least 8gb is recommended
* Optionally a keyboard, and a monitor. But we're going to learn how to control a pi without these in the next video.
