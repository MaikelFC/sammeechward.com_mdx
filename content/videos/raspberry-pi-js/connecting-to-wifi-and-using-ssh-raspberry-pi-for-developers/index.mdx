In this video, I will show you how to connect your raspberry pi to a wifi network and log in to the pi to control it wirelessly using SSH. This is called a headless setup.

This is the second in a video series about how to get started making things with a raspberry pi. It is targeted at existing developers but will be helpful to you no matter what your background is.

In the previous video, I showed you how to set up your raspberry pi and install Raspbian: [https://youtu.be/hArqrFTq5vQ](https://youtu.be/hArqrFTq5vQ)

For this video, you will need a raspberry pi with Raspbian Linux installed.
